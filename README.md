# Shotgun Resume
A realistic job hunt simulator developed for [AtlasHacks2 2021](https://devpost.com/software/placeholder-g1ncqu).

## Motivation
Due to all of us wanting to learn game development, we decided that AtlasHack2's 'creative' section was the best excuse to do so. As such, we quickly decided on a simple concept of
getting a job through the 'shotgun-method', albeit a tad more literal Thus, we've created Shotgun Resume, an unfinished job-hunt simulator where players would shoot their resumes
at managers with a shotgun in hopes of receiving a job offer.

## Project Status
Unfinished, although the game is still in a (somewhat) playable state. There are no current or future plans to finish making this game.
